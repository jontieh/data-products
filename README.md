# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project was:

1. To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and
2. To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.

The code used for the Shiny application can be found under: [https://github.com/jontieh/data-products/tree/master/app](https://github.com/jontieh/data-products/tree/master/app).

The application itself provides a service for prediction of house prices in San Francisco. It is available online under the following link: [https://jontieh.shinyapps.io/house-price-estimator/](https://jontieh.shinyapps.io/house-price-estimator/).

The reproducible pitch presentation about this application is available under: [http://rpubs.com/jontieh/housepriceestimator](http://rpubs.com/jontieh/housepriceestimator).
